# TECHNOLOGY-AND-INFORMATION-SYSTEM
Technology and Information Systems are closely linked to Computer Science because they focus on how computing technologies are applied in real-world contexts. While computer science emphasizes theory and problem-solving, information systems apply these concepts to manage data, support decision-making, and improve organizational efficiency. Learning about information systems has helped me understand how computer science principles are used to build practical and impactful technological solutions.

## Assignment 1
This assignment is a vlog about Open Day UTMDigital 2025. The event was very informative, helping students gain a deeper understanding of UTM's digital infrastructure. In addition, many companies set up booths to promote their services and products. This was very helpful for computer science students to understand today's technological advancements.

## [Assignment 2](https://github.com/alicegan524/TECHNOLOGY-AND-INFORMATION-SYSTEM/blob/main/PPG%20TALK.png)
This assignment involves creating a poster for a PPG industry talk. The talk aims to help students gain a deeper understanding of the company from the perspectives of infrastructure, operations, and key areas. This will help students prepare before their internship and understand the company's specific requirements.

## Assignment 3
This assignment is a report for Industry Talk 2. The talk emphasized the importance of project management in industry work. We not only need to improve our basic skills, but also strengthen teamwork, as we need to collaborate with team members during project implementation. Furthermore, good communication skills are crucial for minimizing conflicts among team members.

## [PC Assemble](https://github.com/alicegan524/TECHNOLOGY-AND-INFORMATION-SYSTEM/blob/main/PC%20Assemble.jpg)
In this lab, I assembled a PC from scratch and learned how all the components connect and work together. I enjoyed seeing the CPU, RAM, and storage fit into the motherboard and how the system comes to life when powered on. This hands-on experience gave me a clearer understanding of computer hardware and made me feel more confident about building and maintaining PCs in the future.

## Project Design Thinking
Our group received design thinking training focused on mental health. This enhanced our problem-solving skills, as our task was to find solutions to the challenges facing the field of mental health today. Once we developed a solution, we needed to optimize it based on user feedback. This process presented a significant challenge to teamwork due to the different roles each person had.

## Asean Quantum Summit 2025
Attending the ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025 helped me understand how important quantum technology is becoming in Southeast Asia. The talks covered quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum sensing, which made me realize that these areas could change the way we approach problems in computer science, from algorithms to data security. As a computer science student, it was eye-opening to see how ASEAN countries are starting to collaborate and plan for the future of quantum technology. The summit also highlighted the importance of learning new skills, especially in quantum algorithms and programming, to stay relevant in the field. Overall, the event made me more curious about quantum computing and motivated me to start exploring how it could connect with my studies and future career.
